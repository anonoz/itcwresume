<p>Hi <%= @recruiter_name %>,</p>

<p>Greetings from <a href="https://www.techcareerdays.org" target="_blank">IT Job Expo</a> team.</p>

<p>We are just two weeks away from the event, and we are pleased to inform that our centralised resume submission platform is ready.</p>

<p>The following is your credential needed for you to access the portal.</p>

<p>ID: <%= @recruiter_email %><br>
Password: <%= @password %></p>

<a class="button" href="https://resumetcd.herokuapp.com/resumes" target="_blank">Sign In To IJE Resume</a>

<p>If the button does not work, here's the direct link: https://resumetcd.herokuapp.com/resumes</p>
<p>In this portal, you may review candidatesâ€™ resumes, which are categorized according to the type of employment they are seeking for (full-time or internship), and whether they are Malaysian or non-Malaysian. As we get closer to the event, there will be more students submitting their resumes, so do check back often.</p>

<p>Should any of the candidate(s) catches your attention - you may contact them prior to the event day or even set appointment to have the interview during the IT Job Expo itself. We are providing 2 interview booths that could be utilized by any of our participating employers throughout the day. No booking required.</p>

<p>We are hoping that this could improve the overall experience of the event, and do let us know should you have suggestion on how to make this better.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Regards,<br/>
IT Job Expo Team</p>
